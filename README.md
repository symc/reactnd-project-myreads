## MyReads

This is an implementation of the first project for  Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The single page app contains three book shelves. Each shelf contains a 
set of books. The user can:
- Click on a badge at the bottom left of a book to change the shelf of the book
- Click on the "plus" button to open up a search page
- Type a query entry to search and display a list of books matching this search
query and change the shelf value of any of the displayed books.

## Known issues

The app is using a search API that is provided by the course instructors. This API 
only accepts a set of search queries. Consequently, the search may not display some of the books that are visible in the main page of the app. For a full list of 
allowed search terms, please check SEARCH_TERMS.md

## Installation

You can follow the directions below to install and run the app:

* Install Node.js and npm. For more information, please check https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
